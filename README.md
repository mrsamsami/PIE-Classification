# PIE-Classification

It is a binary classification task where a Potentially Idiomatic Expression (PIE) is classified as being in its literal/idiomatic sense using contextual information. 
The term **potentially idiomatic expression** refers to those expressions which can have an idiomatic meaning, regardless of whether they actually have that meaning in a given context. PIEs are like idiomatic expressions, but the term also covers literal uses of idiomatic expressions.
